# Smart Match AI - Deployment Guide

## Issue Resolution

Your application was failing in production because the **MISTRAL_API_KEY** environment variable wasn't configured on Render. This caused the Mistral API calls to fail, resulting in default responses with "Could not parse result due to an error."

## Required Environment Variables

### For FastAPI Service (Render)
You need to set these environment variables in your Render FastAPI service:

1. **MISTRAL_API_KEY** (Required)
   - Your Mistral AI API key for resume parsing and matching
   - Get it from: https://console.mistral.ai/

2. **MONGO_URL** (Required)
   - Your MongoDB connection string
   - Format: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database`

### For Node.js Backend (Render)
You need to set these environment variables in your Render Node.js service:

1. **MONGO_URL** (Required)
   - Same MongoDB connection string as above

## How to Set Environment Variables on Render

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your FastAPI service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add the following variables:
   - Key: `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, Value: `your_actual_mistral_api_key`
   - Key: `MONGO_URL`, Value: `your_mongodb_connection_string`
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Your service will automatically redeploy

## Verification Steps

After setting the environment variables:

1. Check the deployment logs in Render
2. Look for these success messages:
   - `✅ Environment variables validated successfully`
   - `✅ MONGO_URL configured: mongodb+srv://...`
   - `✅ MISTRAL_API_KEY configured: ****`
   - `✅ MongoDB connected to database: test`

3. Test the matching functionality:
   - The app should now return proper candidate information instead of "N/A"
   - Scores should be calculated correctly (not 0)
   - Skills arrays should be populated
   - Summary should contain actual analysis instead of error messages

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "Could not parse result due to an error":
1. Check Render logs for API key validation errors
2. Verify your Mistral API key is valid and has sufficient credits
3. Check network connectivity between Render and Mistral API

### If you see "Processing failed" entries:
1. Check the specific error message in the summary field
2. Look at Render logs for detailed error information
3. Verify PDF files are properly stored in MongoDB

### Common Issues:
- **Invalid API Key**: Double-check your Mistral API key
- **MongoDB Connection**: Verify your MONGO_URL format and credentials
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all packages in requirements.txt are installed

## Testing Locally vs Production

### Local Development:
- Uses `.env` file for environment variables
- Should work with your current setup

### Production (Render):
- Uses Render's environment variable system
- No `.env` file needed
- Environment variables must be set in Render dashboard

## Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (Vercel) → Backend (Render Node.js) → FastAPI (Render Python) → Mistral AI API
                                            ↓
                                        MongoDB Atlas
```

The FastAPI service handles:
- Resume parsing using Mistral AI
- Job-candidate matching using Mistral AI
- MongoDB operations for storing results

## Next Steps

1. Set the environment variables in Render as described above
2. Wait for the automatic redeployment
3. Test the matching functionality
4. Monitor the logs for any remaining issues

Your application should now work correctly in production!
